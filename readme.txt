A. Features to add:

1. Increase efficiency of flightlist and passengerlist
    - Print 4 in 1 loop iteration
        - Thereby cutting number of iterations from n to n/4
2. Design and implement algorithm to assign passengers
    - 2 algorithms to improve experiment results


B. Assumptions made:

1. All flights go from point A to point B
2. All flights have a capacity of 600
3. All passengers go from point A to point B
4. All passengers have no specific travel date and time
 - As such, passengers can be alloted into any flights as needed


C. Algorithm design

1. Quarter sample loop assign - O(n/4)
2. Whole sample divide assign - O(1)
